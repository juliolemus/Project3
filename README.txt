Solution: I followed the grammar description on the project page, created my grammar from those specifications, and inputed the grammar into the parser.y file. My lexer.l has all token rules in it that return a token when the the string representation is recognized from the input file. The parser.y file has my grammar in addition to the Expression part given on the project website.
